# Cavemapper
Bludgeoning my way through a toy project as an attempt to learn a little lisp.

Using caveman2 framework for the backend and react for the frontend.

## Usage
These are really just for me.
```
,cd ~/dev/projects/cavemapper
(push (truename ".") asdf:*central-registry*)
(ql:quickload '(cavemapper))
```
