# Cavemapper
Bludgeoning my way through a toy project as an attempt to learn a little lisp.

Using caveman2 framework for the backend and react for the frontend.

## Usage
These are really just for me.
```
(pushnew (truename "/home/tosh/dev/projects/cavemapper") ql:*local-project-directories*)
(ql:register-local-projects)
(ql:quickload :cavemapper)
```
